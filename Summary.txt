Etiquettes for contributing in Open-Source Projects


There are a couple of things we should always be thoughtful of while contributing to Open-Source Projects : 

1.) First and foremost, we should keep in mind our purpose behind our decision to contribute. Wanting to help others or demonstrating our skill are some good reasons.

2.) Being kind is also an important thing to remember. Our queries and responses in an Open-Source Project should be polite and respectful.

3.) Our contributions to the project should be productive - such as fixing bugs, issues or documentation. We shouldn't change anything without permission simply based on our own personal preferences.

4.) Reading the documentation is also quite important before contributing since it usually contains the solutions to many common doubts.

5.) We should also try to refrain from adding anything irrelevant or non-productive since it only contributes to incresaing the noise. Some ways to achieve that are discusiing only a single topic in its own issue, making separate PRs for fixing each issue, etc.

6.) If any decision is made in the project (by the moderators or through a vote) that might be against our preference, we should accept it in a mature manner.

7.) Lastly, we should expect others' time and their availability on the given project and not demand very quick replies.
